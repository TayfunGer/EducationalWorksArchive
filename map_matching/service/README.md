# Cooperative Map Matching for Autonomous Mobile Robots

Welcome to the Cooperative Map Matching project! This project is focusing on implementing a cooperative localization technique for autonomous mobile robots. The method estimates a transformation by utilizing the ORB algorithm to identify keypoints in two maps provided by two robots.

## Overview

This project serves as the focal point of my Bachelor's thesis, aiming to develop and implement a cooperative localization method for enhancing the autonomous navigation capabilities of robots. By leveraging the ORB algorithm, keypoints are extracted from maps shared by two robots, enabling a transformation estimation crucial for precise localization.

## Key Features

- **Cooperative Localization:** Enables multiple robots to collaborate in estimating their positions within shared environments.
- **ORB Algorithm:** Utilizes ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) algorithm for feature detection and matching between robot-generated maps.
- **Transformation Estimation:** The keypoints identified using ORB assist in estimating the transformation between the maps for accurate localization.
