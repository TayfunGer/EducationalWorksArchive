# Machine learning of specifications for the detection of safety-critical driving behavior

Welcome to the machine_learning_specification project! This project focuses on learning traffic specifications using machine learning techniques. A feed-forward neural network has been developed for this purpose, leveraging tools such as Keras, TensorFlow, and Pandas. The required data was generated by simulating a lane-changing maneuver between two vehicles using the CARLA Simulator. Additionally, another scenario was created to validate the results of the developed neural network.

## Project Overview

This project forms the core of my Master's thesis, aiming to employ machine learning methodologies, particularly a feed-forward neural network, to understand and analyze traffic specifications. Keras, TensorFlow, and Pandas were integral tools used for development and analysis, while the CARLA Simulator facilitated data generation by simulating specific traffic scenarios.

## Key Components

- **Feed-forward Neural Network:** Developed using Keras and TensorFlow to analyze and learn traffic specifications.
- **Tools Used:** Utilized Keras, TensorFlow, and Pandas for development, training, and analysis.
- **Data Generation:** CARLA Simulator was employed to simulate lane-changing maneuvers and scenarios for generating required data.
- **Validation:** Created additional scenarios to validate and evaluate the performance of the developed neural network.
